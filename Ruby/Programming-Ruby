# Ruby Is an Object-Oriented Language

Everything in Ruby is object
# puts -1234.abs #print 1234
# puts 4.even? # print true

# if a method have one parameter then its not mandatory to write first bracket after function name
e.g puts 'hello' => puts("Hello")

def say_goodnight(name)
  return "Good night "+ name;
end
puts say_goodnight "farhan"

#String Double Quote / Single Quote
 - In the single-quoted case, Ruby does very little.
 - In the double-quoted case, Ruby does more work.

  When a string containing
a newline is output, that newline becomes a line break:
puts "And good night,\nGrandma"

  The second thing that Ruby does with double-quoted strings is expression interpolation.

  def say_goodnight(name)
    result = "Good night, #{name}"
    return result
  end
